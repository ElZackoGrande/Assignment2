# Assignment2
Contains code, screenshots, and readme file. 
Truthfully, this assignment felt far beyond the material covered in class but I tried my best the best way I knew how. The code would work even if its not as clean as it should be.
I believe that a solution toward the smaller test file that came with the larger file for the assignment would have filled in the missing pieces.
